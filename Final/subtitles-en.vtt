00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.840
Welcome to the final video of this Machine Learning class.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.473
We've been through a lot of different videos together.

3
00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.774
In this video I would like to just quickly

4
00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.003
summarize the main topics of this course

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.089
and then say a few words at the end and that

6
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.729
will wrap up the class.

7
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.020
So what have we done?

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.957
In this class we spent a lot of time talking about supervised learning algorithms

9
00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:25.436
like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs.

10
00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:29.435
for problems where you have labelled data and labelled examples

11
00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:31.300
like x(i), y(i)

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.715
And we also spent quite a lot of time talking about unsupervised learning

13
00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:37.344
like K-means clustering,

14
00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:40.316
Principal Components Analysis for dimensionality reduction

15
00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.847
and Anomaly Detection algorithms for when you have only

16
00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.363
unlabelled data x(i)

17
00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:49.378
Although Anomaly Detection can also use some labelled data

18
00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:51.189
to evaluate the algorithm.

19
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.725
We also spent some time talking about special applications

20
00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.407
or special topics like Recommender Systems

21
00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:58.895
and large scale machine learning systems

22
00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:01.477
including parallelized and rapid-use systems

23
00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:03.925
as well as some special applications like

24
00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:07.609
sliding windows object classification for computer vision.

25
00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.549
And finally we also spent a lot of time talking about different aspects

26
00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.198
of, sort of, advice on building a machine learning system.

27
00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:17.264
And this involved both trying to understand

28
00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:19.233
what is it that makes a machine learning algorithm

29
00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.561
work or not work.

30
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.012
So we talked about things like bias and variance,

31
00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:25.479
and how regularization can help with some variance problems.

32
00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.445
And we also spent a little bit of time talking about

33
00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:32.313
this question of how to decide what to work on next.

34
00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:35.019
So, how to prioritize how you spend your time

35
00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.513
when you're developing a machine learning system.

36
00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:41.044
So we talked about evaluation of learning algorithms,

37
00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:44.221
evaluation metrics like  precision recall, F1 score

38
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.072
as well as practical aspects of evaluation

39
00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:49.898
like the training, cross-validation and test sets.

40
00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:52.319
And we also spent a lot of time talking about

41
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.741
debugging learning algorithms and making sure

42
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.212
the learning algorithm is working.

43
00:01:57.212 --> 00:01:59.075
So we talked about diagnostics

44
00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:01.999
like learning curves and also talked about things like

45
00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.394
error analysis and ceiling analysis.

46
00:02:04.394 --> 00:02:08.187
And so all of these were different tools for helping you to decide

47
00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.349
what to do next and how to spend your valuable

48
00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.585
time when you're developing a machine learning system.

49
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:17.665
And in addition to having the tools of machine learning at your disposal

50
00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:20.228
so knowing the tools of machine learning like

51
00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:22.127
supervised learning and unsupervised learning and so on,

52
00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:26.015
I hope that you now not only have the tools,

53
00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:29.457
but that you know how to apply these tools really well

54
00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:32.658
to build powerful machine learning systems.

55
00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:35.556
So, that's it.

56
00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.645
Those were the topics of this class

57
00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:39.614
and if you worked all the way through this course

58
00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:41.308
you should now consider yourself

59
00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.511
an expert in machine learning.

60
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:46.879
As you know, machine learning is a technology

61
00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.916
that's having huge impact on science, technology and industry.

62
00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:53.360
And you're now well qualified to use these tools

63
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.351
of machine learning to great effect.

64
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.910
I hope that many of you in this class

65
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.765
will find ways to use machine learning

66
00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:02.324
to build cool systems and cool applications

67
00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:03.946
and cool products.

68
00:03:03.946 --> 00:03:06.084
And I hope that you find ways

69
00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:07.930
to use machine learning not only

70
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.762
to make <i>your</i> life better but maybe someday

71
00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:14.749
to use it to make many other people's life better as well.

72
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.699
I also wanted to let you know that this class has been great fun for me to teach.

73
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.788
So, thank you for that.

74
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:23.807
And before wrapping up,

75
00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:25.282
there's just one last thing I wanted to say.

76
00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:28.956
Which is that: It was maybe not so long ago,

77
00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:31.306
that I was a student myself.

78
00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:34.711
And even today, you know, I still try to take different courses

79
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:36.902
when I have time to try to learn new things.

80
00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:39.989
And so I know how time-consuming it is

81
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.273
to learn this stuff.

82
00:03:42.273 --> 00:03:44.663
I know that you're probably a busy person

83
00:03:44.663 --> 00:03:47.302
with many, many other things going on in your life.

84
00:03:47.302 --> 00:03:49.838
And so the fact that you still found

85
00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.431
the time or took the time to watch these videos

86
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.799
and, you know, many of these videos just went on

87
00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.598
for hours, right?

88
00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:00.068
And the fact many of you took the time

89
00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:01.826
to go through the review questions

90
00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:03.731
and that many of you took the time

91
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.250
to work through the programming exercises.

92
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.483
And these were long and complicate programming exercises.

93
00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:12.840
I wanted to say thank you for that.

94
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.920
And I know that many of you have worked hard on this class

95
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.880
and that many of you have put a lot of time into this class,

96
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.396
that many of you have put a lot of yourselves into this class.

97
00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:29.292
So I hope that you also got a lot of out this class.

98
00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:31.347
And I wanted to say:

99
00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:36.423
Thank you very much for having been a student in this class.
